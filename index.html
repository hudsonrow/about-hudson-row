        The best way to get to know me is through a bar of <strong>Tony's Chocolonely Chocolate</strong>.
        I love good food and my cat, Dale. I'll add a picture of her. I was born and raised here in Albuquerque, with 3 other siblings (I am the youngest).
        I like to climb rocks like my distant relatives, the neanderthals. That's the best summation of myself that I can think of.
