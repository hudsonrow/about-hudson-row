        The best way to get to know me is through a bar of <strong>Tony's Chocolonely Chocolate</strong>.

        I love good food and my cat, Dale. I'll include a pic of her.

        I was born and raised here in Albuquerque, with 3 other siblings (I am the youngest).

        I like to climb rocks like my distant relatives, the neanderthals.
