        The best way to get to know me is to write a <strong>PhD dissertation</strong> about my life.

        I'm actually the namesake of the Hudson River in New York. They named it after me when I saved NYC from an invasion of sharks. I'll include a pic of the river.

        I was born and raised in the wilderness, with 3 capybaras (I am the youngest).

        I like to climb rocks like my <em>close relatives</em>, the neanderthals.
